## What Does This Project Do?
### This COMPLETELY fictional training module trains users how to manage files and track variants that exist on multiple timelines through a simulation of how a typical TVA agent starts their day tracking variants. It is inspired by the Marvel comicbook and cinematic universe plotlines of What If?, where it is exposed that their are variants of our most beloved heros AND VILLAINS that have totally different stories in other universes and timelines.

## Wins!
### I am really interested in the philosophy behind mobile-first design, so I'm really glad that this website it 100% responsive, it's a first for me!
### I actually got all my functionality done before doing absolutely any styling. It is ...mostly worth it. It was more rewarding to actually make it all fancy at the END. I like the way it turned out!
### I am confident in my post grad experience building APIs for myself, with others, and for others. I actully cam up with two ideas for APIs that I wished existed.
### This app was tough to build because I had a lot of review of material to catch up on before I could start building. Once I got going, I got going. Once I realized that I burned a lot of time trying to "hack" Marvel's api with their strict requirements, I quickly adapted and just built my own. 
### Around this time in my previous bootcamp, I got really sick and could not complete the bootcamp. Beyond financial frustration, that was a huge mental defeat, and did not know how I was going to continue learning how to code when I do not learn well on my own, so I am beyond hype to have built this website and officially surpassed Unit 2 of this bootcamp. Thank you to the instructors for your feedback, it has kept me going when I have my doubts on my abilities as coder.

## Lessons Learned not losses!
### Thanks to Thiago, I now know how to hash passwords even though I didn't get to use Marvel's API directly in my project. I ran a bunch of test calls in their interactive documentation to built my API. I built in some hashing to make teh badge ids for the users to access the database as a homage to the struggle! I started studying algorithms and have an idea on how to build my own hashing algorithm. it'll be a slightly more sophisticated password generator but I'm excited to build so many more things now!

## Stretch goals
### Maps UI that visually tracks variants 
### passkey to access the database
### more animations
